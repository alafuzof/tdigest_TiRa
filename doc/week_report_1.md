# Week report 1

# What I've done

- Project created
- Github setup
- Research into t-digest and other similar algorithms
- Looking into the libavl C-libary for the initial implementation of the
  balanced search trees needed

This week was not very productive due to the combination of the exam week and
Christmas preparations. Most of the work consisted of literature research.

## Problems

The article describing t-digest from Dunning and Ertl lacks some detail in 
terms of the asymptotic time performance of the algorithm (memory performance 
gets a lot more attention). Thus, the performance part of the design document
may need some more work, once I have a better grasp on the corner cases of the
algorithm.

## What I've learned

The libavl library is really quite nice in terms of learning how balanced
search trees are implemented in practice. 

## what's next

Implementing the core t-digest algorithm using libavl for the relevant parts
(sorting).
